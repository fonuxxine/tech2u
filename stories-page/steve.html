        <h2>“Alex never left me starting a lecture without knowing that everything was working perfectly”</h2>
        <p>
            Barbara Ballyk has taught at the university for 20 years and has developed a strong teaching approach
            focused on student
            engagement, however when confronted with the decision to offer her lessons through dual delivery, she knew
            she’d need
            support. Barbara reached out to Tech2U for help in providing lectures optimal for a hybrid class. An
            additional
            challenge was to ensure that her teaching method of annotating slides and adding text by hand was equally
            engaging for
            her students physically in the class and in virtual attendance.
            <br><br>
            Barbara reached out to the Tech2U team and was connected with a Co-Pilot, Alex, who successfully addressed
            each tech
            challenge Barbara was faced with. For instance, she was concerned about volume because she wanted to make
            sure she was
            adequately heard by her remote students and that they could also be heard by everyone physically in class.
            She also
            hoped to show all students her annotations throughout the lecture. While Alex did admit that this part was
            challenging
            to set up due to having to connect various equipment including the touch screen monitor and web cam, his
            collaboration
            with Barbara ultimately guaranteed smooth lectures all year long. For Barbara, it was a huge relief to know
            that by the
            time she was ready to start class, everything was already set up and the only thing she had to focus on was
            her lecture.
            <br><br>
            By the end of the year, students expressed gratitude to Barbara and Tech2U for dedicating so much effort to
            the
            technical aspect of class. Barbara also reflected on her collaboration with her Co-Pilot and the strong
            rapport she
            built with him and realized how much she’d learned from him. Overall, the support Barbara received from
            Tech2U gave her
            security in knowing she could rely on her Co-Pilot for tech issues and be provided the space she needed to
            teach
            engaging lessons.
            <br><br>
