        <h2>“For me, Tech2U was an opportunity to improve the quality of what I could record in the classroom for the
            students.” </h2>
        <p>
            Kinesiology and Physical Education professor Doug Richards wanted to record his lectures in a way that captured
            his physical demonstrations and use of anatomical models, like a show-and-tell section, but he was not sure how.
            When he reached out to Tech2U, the team addressed his concern about being able to seamlessly switch between his
            PowerPoint lecture and demonstrations on the screen at the front of the room, and in what was recorded for
            future viewing.
            <br /><br />
            The Tech2U team supported Doug's creative lecture style by providing him with recording equipment that allowed
            him to confidently engage with his material. The PTZ camera was set up in the fourth row of the lecture theatre
            to enable a wide-angle capture of his demonstrations. Doug was also given a PTZ remote that gave him the freedom
            to switch between wide angle views for whole body demonstrations and zoomed-in views for demonstrations with
            anatomical models of the knee or shoulder. Doug reports that the support he received from Tech2U and his
            co-pilot helped him feel more comfortable with the technology required for his lectures, especially since
            everything was set up in advance. In fact, by the end of the term, Doug reported that Tech2U's work in providing
            technology for his lectures boosted his confidence and using it on his own “became second nature”.
            <br /><br />
            With Tech2U's assistance in simplifying the technology setup to familiarize Doug with the recording equipment,
            he noted being able to conduct his classes without any worry. Doug also reports that he received positive
            feedback from his students, who appreciated the way his lectures were recorded. Support from Tech2U was
            essential for Doug's lecture recordings because they eased his transition from hybrid and in-person learning,
            which was extremely valuable. Overall, Tech2U helped Doug improve the quality of his recordings and supported
            his engaging teaching practice.
            <br /><br />
