        <h2>“The Tech2U team was really, really crucial in helping me navigate the big unknowns”</h2>
        <p>
            Shirley Yeung, a first-time instructor at the University of Toronto, found it overwhelming to navigate through
            the
            classroom setting and had anxieties surrounding access to support. These anxieties began impacting her teaching,
            and
            eventually raised concerns about the quality of her instruction as the University shifts back to primarily
            in-person
            delivery. She wanted to learn about the teaching options available to her, and the options she could make
            available to
            her students. This assistant professor wanted to offer her classes in a dual delivery style but was unsure of
            how to go
            about setting up a dual environment and who to ask for help. Shirley notes that knowing what was possible was a
            struggle
            that Tech2U addressed.
            <br /><br />
            The solution provided to her by the Tech2U team was a piece of technology, the Yamaha CS-700, that allowed her
            to
            provide her virtual audience with a view of their instructor as well as the students in the room. The Yamaha
            setup
            allowed her slides to be centralized on her primary device and provided her with an optimal microphone to speak
            to both
            her in-person and virtual students. Shirley reports that the work of the Tech2U team normalizes accessibility
            for both
            the instructor and student. Not only did she receive the support she needed, but that support also resulted in
            her
            creating channels of access for students. She strives to create accessible learning environments regardless of
            who needs
            it and aims to provide them as a default.
            <br /><br />
            The technological expertise, support, and equipment that the team brings allows students to focus on content and
            creativity rather than the punitive impacts of missing lectures. Tech2U provided Shirley not only with hands-on
            technical support, but also a direct contact to go to when in need of any assistance. The University has a
            multitude of
            resources that can be complicated to navigate through, especially for a first-time instructor, so Shirley
            appreciates
            that Tech2U provides such valuable assistance and support.
            <br /><br />

            Tech2U team.
