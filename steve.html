        <h2>"Our view of what we're supposed to be doing has changed, the view of education has changed, and what our job is
            has changed."</h2>
        <p>
            Steven Treiber, sessional lecturer in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, needed
            technology that would support his flipped-format class which included using a combination of live and recorded
            sessions with students in Canada, China, and across Europe. Unique to Steven's teaching, he wanted to
            incorporate a guest lecturer in San Francisco. Additionally, he struggled to manage the sound quality of his
            lectures, which was a key aspect to providing an immersive classroom experience.
            <br /><br />
            Steven was able to enhance students' learning and innovate his teaching style with the help of Tech2U. Students
            and guest speakers were able to connect on a global scale with the newly installed Point, Tilt, Zoom (PTZ)
            camera, which allowed students in the classroom to interact with those outside. Tech2U installed the technology
            to improve audio by creating a stimulating and accessible learning environment. This was extremely important for
            students, as a few took the course because the timing would permit them to graduate early, and others told him
            the remote factor was important because they would be out of the country.
            <br /><br />
            Steven explained that Tech2U was able to help him realize his teaching goals and inspire students to interact
            with each other. The support Steven received from Tech2U helped him clarify his technical teaching needs and
            gave him space to innovate his teaching moving forward.
            <br /><br />
